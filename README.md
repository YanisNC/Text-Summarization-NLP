# Text-Summarization-NLP

I've developed an API for text summarization, which can be used through streamlit.

To use the unlimited version with a lot of different transformer models, follow the instructions:
#### 1. Install the requirements.txt packages.
#### 2. Run the following command in your local terminal (same directory as the .py file)
#####    $ *streamlit run streamlit_app_unlimited.py*
